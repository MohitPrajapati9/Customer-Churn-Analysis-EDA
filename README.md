# Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA
Analyzed customer data using Python to find why customers leave (churn). Explored factors like contract type, charges, and payment methods. Found patterns through charts to help reduce churn and improve retention. Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA.

### What I did:

- Looked at the data to understand what it contains.

- Found out how many customers left and how many stayed.

- Checked which factors (like contract type, monthly bill, payment method, etc.) are linked to customers leaving.

- Made charts and graphs to see the patterns clearly.

### Tools Used:

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook

### What I learned:

- Customers with short contracts and high bills leave more often.

- Customers who stayed longer with the company usually donâ€™t leave.

# Summary & Key Insights
### Key Observations:
- Churn Rate: About 26.5% of customers have churned.
- Contract Type:
  - Customers on month-to-month contracts churn significantly more than those on longer-term contracts.
- Internet Service:
  - Customers with fiber optic internet are more likely to churn than those with DSL or no internet.
- Payment Method:
  - Electronic check users show higher churn rates compared to other payment methods.
- Senior Citizens:
  - Senior citizens churn at a slightly higher rate than non-seniors.
- Monthly Charges:
  - Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
- Tenure:
  - New customers (with low tenure) have a higher churn rate. Long-term customers are more loyal.
