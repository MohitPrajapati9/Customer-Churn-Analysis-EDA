# Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA-
Analyzed customer data using Python to find why customers leave (churn). Explored factors like contract type, charges, and payment methods. Found patterns through charts to help reduce churn and improve retention. Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for EDA.
What I did:

Looked at the data to understand what it contains.

Found out how many customers left and how many stayed.

Checked which factors (like contract type, monthly bill, payment method, etc.) are linked to customers leaving.

Made charts and graphs to see the patterns clearly.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

What I learned:

Customers with short contracts and high bills leave more often.

Customers who stayed longer with the company usually donâ€™t leave.

Some payment methods are linked to higher chances of leaving.
